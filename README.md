Here are my exercise codes:

Preprocessing Notes: Detailed steps explaining how data preprocessing is performed, including necessary transformations and preparations.
Matplotlib Exercise Code: Examples focused on data analysis and visualization, demonstrating the creation of insightful plots and graphs.
Scikit-Learn Exercise Code: Implementations of machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

Additionally, I have included implementations of various algorithms, including:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Polynomial Regression
